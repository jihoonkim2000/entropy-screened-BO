# entropy-screened-BO
## Introduction
This is a repository with open source code and the dataset for the paper "Artificial Intelligence-Driven Discovery of High-Entropy Alloys for Optimal Water Splitting Using Configuration Entropy and Design of Experiments". To run the entropy-screened BO.ipynb, use Entropy-screened BO dataset.csv. To run the bare BO with upper confidence bound (UCB), use Bare BO dataset.csv. Training the GPR model and plotting the overpotential with respect to element composition may take few minutes, depending on your hardware.
